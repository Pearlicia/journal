Question 1:
You find yourself in a challenging situation during a production call where both you and your team mate are present. The escalated issue was resolved by you, yet your team mate is taking credit for the resolution. What steps will you take in this scenario?

Answer:
In such a scenario, where my team mate claims credit for a resolution I achieved, I'd opt for a diplomatic approach. First, I'd appreciate the successful resolution in the team's context. Following this, I'd have a private conversation with my colleague, expressing my concerns and highlighting my contributions without directly discrediting them. My aim would be to foster a collaborative and fair acknowledgment of efforts while ensuring our focus remains on efficient problem-solving and maintaining a harmonious team dynamic.
