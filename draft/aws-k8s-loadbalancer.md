The AWS Load Balancer Controller is a Kubernetes controller that manages Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) on AWS. It automates the creation and deletion of load balancers based on Kubernetes service objects.

When a Kubernetes service is created, the AWS Load Balancer Controller creates an ELB with the necessary configuration to route traffic to the service. As pods are added or removed from the service, the controller updates the ELB with the new backend targets.

The controller uses Kubernetes annotations to specify the desired configuration for the ELB, such as the type of load balancer, listeners, SSL certificates, and target groups.

Overall, the AWS Load Balancer Controller simplifies the management of load balancers on AWS by integrating with Kubernetes.
