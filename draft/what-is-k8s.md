Let's simplify Kubernetes Learning Journey in a single post:

What is Kubernetes?

An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

Why use Kubernetes?:
Achieve high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery with minimal manual intervention.

Architecture:
Understand the blueprint of Kubernetes' master and worker nodes.
Can refer to this video: https://bit.ly/3M5ZwGx

Master Node: The control plane that manages the Kubernetes cluster.
Worker Node: The machines, VMs, or physical computers that run applications.

API Server: The entry point for commands in a Kubernetes cluster.
etcd: Consistent and highly-available key-value store for all cluster data.
Controller Manager: Regulates controllers ensuring the desired state of the cluster.
Scheduler: Assigns work, in the form of pods, to worker nodes.
Kubelet: Ensures the containers are running in a Pod.
Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules for Pod communication.
Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers.

Core Concepts:
Grasp the fundamental building blocks of Kubernetes.

Pods: The smallest deployable units that can be created and managed.
Services: An abstract way to expose applications running on a set of Pods.
Volumes: Persistent storage provisioned for containerized applications.
Namespaces: Supports multiple virtual clusters within the same physical cluster.

Deployment & Scaling:
Manage the lifecycle and scalability of applications.

Deployments: Ensure desired numbers of Pod replicas are maintained.
ReplicaSets: Maintains a stable set of replica Pods.
StatefulSets: Manages stateful applications.
DaemonSets: Ensures nodes run a copy of a specific Pod.

Networking:
Facilitate communication between Pods and external networks.

Service Networking: Expose services to traffic outside the cluster.
Ingress Controllers: Manage external access to services.
Network Policies: Define how Pods communicate with each other.

Storage:
Handle persistent storage needs.

Persistent Volumes: Provisioned storage resources.
Persistent Volume Claims: Requests for storage resources.
Storage Classes: Different storage types are provisioned by administrators.

Advanced Topics:
Delve deeper into specialized Kubernetes functionalities.

Helm: The package manager for Kubernetes.
Custom Resource Definitions: Extend the Kubernetes API.
Operators: Automate the management of applications.
Security: Safeguard your Kubernetes cluster.
RBAC: Control who can access the Kubernetes API and what they can do.
Network Policies: Govern how Pods communicate with each other.
Secrets & ConfigMaps: Manage sensitive information and configuration data.


Monitoring & Logging:
Keep a vigilant eye on cluster performance and logs.

Prometheus: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
Grafana: Visualize metrics from Prometheus.
ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for logging.
