40. A media company has an application that tracks user clicks on its websites and performs analytics to provide near-real-time recommendations. The application has a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that receive data from the websites and send the data to an Amazon RDS DB instance for long-term retention. Another fleet of EC2 instances hosts the portion of the application that is continuously checking changes in the database and running SQL queries to provide recommendations.

Management has requested a redesign to decouple the infrastructure. The solution must ensure that data analysts are writing SQL to analyze the new data only. No data can be lost during the deployment.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements and to provide the FASTEST access to the user activity?
