A company is transitioning its Amazon EC2 based MariaDB database to Amazon RDS. The company has already identified a database instance type that will meet the company's CPU and memory requirements. The database must provide at least 40 GiB of storage capacity and 1,000 IOPS.

Which storage configuration for the Amazon RDS for MariaDB instance is MOST cost-effective?

Report Content Errors

A
Provision 350 GiB of magnetic storage for the RDS instance.
Incorrect. Magnetic storage does not support IOPS as a configurable parameter.

For more information about magnetic storage, see Amazon RDS Storage Types.


B
Provision 50 GiB of General Purpose SSD storage for the RDS instance.
Incorrect. Baseline I/O performance for General Purpose SSD storage is 3 IOPS for each GiB, with a minimum of 100 IOPS. For 50 GiB of storage, the baseline performance would be 150 IOPS.


C
Provision 334 GiB of General Purpose SSD storage for the RDS instance.
Correct. Baseline I/O performance for General Purpose SSD storage is 3 IOPS for each GiB. For 334 GiB of storage, the baseline performance would be 1,002 IOPS. Additionally, General Purpose SSD storage is more cost-effective than Provisioned IOPS storage.

For more information about General Purpose SSD storage, see General Purpose SSD Storage.

For more information about Amazon RDS costs, see Amazon RDS for MariaDB Pricing.


D
Provision 50 GiB of Provisioned IOPS storage with 1,000 IOPS for the RDS instance.
Incorrect. 50 GiB of Provisioned IOPS storage with 1,000 IOPS would be more expensive than 334 GiB of General Purpose SSD storage.



A reporting application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. For complex reports, the application can take up to 15 minutes to respond to a request. A solutions architect is concerned that users will receive HTTP 5xx errors if a report request is in process during a scale-in event.

What should the solutions architect do to ensure that user requests will be completed before instances are terminated?

Report Content Errors

A
Enable sticky sessions (session affinity) for the target group of the instances.
Incorrect. If an EC2 instance were removed from the target group during a scale-in process, the EC2 instance would fail (or would be unhealthy if it were checked). An Application Load Balancer would stop routing requests to that target and would choose a new healthy target.

For more information about sticky sessions, see Sticky sessions for your Application Load Balancer.


B
Increase the instance size in the Application Load Balancer target group.
Incorrect. An increase of the instance size likely would increase the speed of processing. However, this solution does not directly ensure that instances that process a request are unaffected by scale-in actions.

For more information about deregistration delay, see Deregistration delay.


C
Increase the cooldown period for the Auto Scaling group to a greater amount of time than the time required for the longest running responses.
Incorrect. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cooldown periods help you prevent Auto Scaling groups from launching or terminating additional instances before the effects of previous activities are apparent.

For more information about cooldown periods, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.


D
Increase the deregistration delay timeout for the target group of the instances to greater than 900 seconds.
Correct. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before the completion of the deregistration process, which can help in-flight requests to the target become complete. To change the amount of time that Elastic Load Balancing waits, update the deregistration delay value.

For more information about deregistration delay, see Deregistration Delay.




A company needs to maintain data records for a minimum of 5 years. The data is rarely accessed after it is stored. The data must be accessible within 2 hours.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

Report Content Errors

A
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Access the data by using AWS Direct Connect.
Incorrect. This solution is not the most cost-effective solution. Amazon S3 is a more cost-effective solution if there is not a requirement for a file system.

For more information about Amazon EFS and Direct Connect, see How Amazon EFS works with AWS Direct Connect and AWS Managed VPN.


B
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Create snapshots. Store the snapshots in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Incorrect. This solution is not the most cost-effective solution because it requires the use of Amazon EBS in addition to Amazon S3.

For more information about EBS snapshots, see Amazon EBS snapshots.


C
Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the data to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
Incorrect. The storage of the data in an S3 bucket provides a cost-effective initial location for the data. However, S3 Standard-IA is not the most cost-effective storage class to meet the requirements in the scenario. The S3 Glacier storage class is designed for low-cost data archiving.

For more information about S3 storage classes, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes.


D
Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the data to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
Correct. The storage of the data in an S3 bucket provides a cost-effective initial location for the data. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is the most cost-effective archival storage solution that meets the requirement of a 2-hour retrieval time.

For more information about how to move data between S3 storage classes automatically, see Managing your storage lifecycle.

For more information about S3 storage classes, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes.




A company has strict data protection requirements. A solutions architect must configure security for a VPC to ensure that backend Amazon RDS DB instances cannot be accessed from the internet. The solutions architect must ensure that the DB instances are accessible from the application tier over a specified port only.

Which actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Specify a DB subnet group that contains only private subnets for the DB instances.
Correct. A private subnet is one component to use to secure the database tier. Internet traffic is not routed to a private subnet. When you place DB instances in a private subnet, you add a layer of security.

For more information about VPCs with public subnets and private subnets, see Routing.


B
Attach an elastic network interface with a private IPv4 address to each DB instance.
Incorrect. An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. The use of an elastic network interface would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about elastic network interfaces, see Elastic network interfaces.


C
Configure AWS Shield with the VPC. Update the route tables for the subnets that the DB instances use.
Incorrect. Shield provides protection against DDoS attacks. Shield cannot be a target of routes in a route table. The use of Shield would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about Shield, see AWS Shield.


D
Configure an AWS Direct Connect connection on the database port between the application tier and the backend.
Incorrect. Direct Connect provides a dedicated connection to your AWS environment. The use of Direct Connect would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about Direct Connect, see AWS Direct Connect features.


E
Add an inbound rule to the database security group that allows requests from the security group of the application tier over the database port. Remove other inbound rules.
Correct. Security groups can restrict access to the DB instances. Security groups provide access from only the application tier on only a specific port.

For more information about security groups, see Security group basics.


A company uses one AWS account to run production workloads. The company has a separate AWS account for its security team. During periodic audits, the security team needs to view specific account settings and resource configurations in the AWS account that runs production workloads. A solutions architect must provide the required access to the security team by designing a solution that follows AWS security best practices.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Create an IAM user for each security team member in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team to each user.
Incorrect. This solution does not follow the security best practice of using roles to delegate permissions.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.


B
Create an IAM role in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team. Add the security team account to the trust policy.
Correct. This solution follows security best practices by using a role to delegate permissions that consist of least privilege access.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.


C
Create a new IAM user in the production account. Assign administrative privileges to the user. Allow the security team to use this account to log in to the systems that need to be accessed.
Incorrect. The assignment of administrative privileges to a user violates security best practices and the principle of least privilege.

For more information about how to grant least privilege in roles, see Grant least privilege.


D
Create an IAM user for each security team member in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team to a new IAM group. Assign the security team members to the group.
Incorrect. This solution does not follow the security best practice of using roles to delegate permissions.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.

A company is designing a disaster recovery (DR) architecture for an important application on AWS. The company has determined that the RTO is 5 minutes with a minimal instance capacity to support the application in the AWS DR site. The company needs to minimize costs for the DR architecture.

Which DR strategy will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Warm standby
Correct. This solution meets the requirement for an RTO of 5 minutes. The instances run at a low capacity and can scale within minutes.

For more information about warm standby, see Plan for Disaster Recovery (DR).


B
Pilot light
Incorrect. This solution would not meet the requirement for an RTO of 5 minutes. The instances are idle and unable to run and scale to full capacity within 5 minutes.


C
Multi-site active-active
Incorrect. Because this is an active-active environment, this solution would address the requirement for an RTO within moments. The services are already running at full capacity within that time. However, this solution costs more than is necessary to meet the company's requirements.

Question
A company has an application that runs on a large general purpose Amazon EC2 instance type that is part of an EC2 Auto Scaling group. The company wants to reduce future costs associated with this application. After the company reviews metrics and logs in Amazon CloudWatch, the company notices that this application runs randomly a couple of times a day to retrieve and manage data. According to CloudWatch, the maximum runtime for each request is 10 minutes, the memory use is 4 GB, and the instances are always in the running state.

Which solution will reduce costs the MOST?

Report Content Errors

A
Deploy the application on a large burstable EC2 instance.
Incorrect. This solution would keep the EC2 instance in the running state 24 hours a day. This solution would not reduce costs.

For more information about EC2 costs, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand Pricing.


B
Refactor the application code to run as an AWS Lambda function.
Correct. Lambda is a fully managed service that would automatically scale when necessary and would be highly available. A solution that deploys the application as a Lambda function reduces costs the most.

For more information about Lambda, see What Is AWS Lambda?


C
Containerize the application by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Host the container on EC2 instances.
Incorrect. This solution would not reduce costs because this solution would still require EC2 instances to be in the running state beyond the run duration of each request.

For more information about Amazon EKS, see Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.


D
Use AWS Instance Scheduler to start and stop the instances based on the runtimes in the logs.
Incorrect. This solution would not be appropriate because the request times are unpredictable. This solution would create scenarios where the application would not be available because instance launches are not correctly scheduled. This solution would also incur unnecessary costs because the company would be charged on an hourly basis for the EC2 instances instead of on the basis of exact runtimes.

For more information about AWS Instance Scheduler, see Instance Scheduler on AWS.
