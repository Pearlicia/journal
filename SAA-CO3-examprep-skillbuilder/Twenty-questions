A company has strict data protection requirements. A solutions architect must configure security for a VPC to ensure that backend Amazon RDS DB instances cannot be accessed from the internet. The solutions architect must ensure that the DB instances are accessible from the application tier over a specified port only.

Which actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Specify a DB subnet group that contains only private subnets for the DB instances.
Correct. A private subnet is one component to use to secure the database tier. Internet traffic is not routed to a private subnet. When you place DB instances in a private subnet, you add a layer of security.

For more information about VPCs with public subnets and private subnets, see Routing.


B
Attach an elastic network interface with a private IPv4 address to each DB instance.
Incorrect. An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. The use of an elastic network interface would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about elastic network interfaces, see Elastic network interfaces.


C
Configure AWS Shield with the VPC. Update the route tables for the subnets that the DB instances use.
Incorrect. Shield provides protection against DDoS attacks. Shield cannot be a target of routes in a route table. The use of Shield would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about Shield, see AWS Shield.


D
Configure an AWS Direct Connect connection on the database port between the application tier and the backend.
Incorrect. Direct Connect provides a dedicated connection to your AWS environment. The use of Direct Connect would not meet the requirements in the scenario.

For more information about Direct Connect, see AWS Direct Connect features.


E
Add an inbound rule to the database security group that allows requests from the security group of the application tier over the database port. Remove other inbound rules.
Correct. Security groups can restrict access to the DB instances. Security groups provide access from only the application tier on only a specific port.

For more information about security groups, see Security group basics.


A company uses one AWS account to run production workloads. The company has a separate AWS account for its security team. During periodic audits, the security team needs to view specific account settings and resource configurations in the AWS account that runs production workloads. A solutions architect must provide the required access to the security team by designing a solution that follows AWS security best practices.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Create an IAM user for each security team member in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team to each user.
Incorrect. This solution does not follow the security best practice of using roles to delegate permissions.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.


B
Create an IAM role in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team. Add the security team account to the trust policy.
Correct. This solution follows security best practices by using a role to delegate permissions that consist of least privilege access.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.


C
Create a new IAM user in the production account. Assign administrative privileges to the user. Allow the security team to use this account to log in to the systems that need to be accessed.
Incorrect. The assignment of administrative privileges to a user violates security best practices and the principle of least privilege.

For more information about how to grant least privilege in roles, see Grant least privilege.


D
Create an IAM user for each security team member in the production account. Attach a permissions policy that provides the permissions required by the security team to a new IAM group. Assign the security team members to the group.
Incorrect. This solution does not follow the security best practice of using roles to delegate permissions.

For more information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see Use roles to delegate permissions.

Question
A company that processes satellite images has an application that runs on AWS. The company stores the images in an Amazon S3 bucket. For compliance reasons, the company must replicate all data once a month to an on-premises location. The average amount of data that the company needs to transfer is 60 TB.

What is the MOST cost-effective way to transfer this data?

Report Content Errors

A
Export the data monthly from the existing S3 bucket to an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Ship the device to the on-premises location. Transfer the data. Return the device a week later.

B
Use S3 bucket replication to copy all objects to a new S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage. Use an AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway to transfer the data from the new S3 bucket to the on-premises location. Delete the images from the new S3 bucket after the transfer of the data.

C
Use S3 bucket replication to copy all objects to a new S3 bucket that uses S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage. Use Amazon S3 to transfer the data from the new S3 bucket to the on-premises location. Delete the images from the new S3 bucket after the transfer of the data.

A company is designing a disaster recovery (DR) architecture for an important application on AWS. The company has determined that the RTO is 5 minutes with a minimal instance capacity to support the application in the AWS DR site. The company needs to minimize costs for the DR architecture.

Which DR strategy will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Warm standby
Correct. This solution meets the requirement for an RTO of 5 minutes. The instances run at a low capacity and can scale within minutes.

For more information about warm standby, see Plan for Disaster Recovery (DR).


B
Pilot light
Incorrect. This solution would not meet the requirement for an RTO of 5 minutes. The instances are idle and unable to run and scale to full capacity within 5 minutes.


C
Multi-site active-active
Incorrect. Because this is an active-active environment, this solution would address the requirement for an RTO within moments. The services are already running at full capacity within that time. However, this solution costs more than is necessary to meet the company's requirements.


D
Backup and restore
Incorrect. This solution would not achieve the RTO of 5 minutes that the company requires.

A company is investigating services to manage vulnerability scans in Amazon EC2 instances and container images that the company stores in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). The service should identify potential software vulnerabilities and categorize the severity of the vulnerabilities.

Which AWS service will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Amazon GuardDuty
Incorrect. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and anomalous behavior. It does not scan for vulnerabilities.

For more information about threat detection services, see Amazon GuardDuty Features.


B
Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager
Incorrect. You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for operating systems and applications. This does not satisfy the requirement to scan EC2 instances and containers for vulnerabilities.

For more information about automated patch management, see AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.


C
Amazon Inspector
Correct. Amazon Inspector removes the operational overhead that is necessary to configure a vulnerability management solution. Amazon Inspector works with both EC2 instances and container images in Amazon ECR to identify potential software vulnerabilities and to categorize the severity of the vulnerabilities.

For more information about automated vulnerability management, see Amazon Inspector Features.


D
AWS Config
Incorrect. AWS Config is a service that gives you the ability to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It does not scan for vulnerabilities or network exposures.

A company needs to look up configuration details about how a Linux-based Amazon EC2 instance was launched.

Which command should a solutions architect run on the EC2 instance to gather the system metadata?

Report Content Errors

A
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
Correct. The only way to retrieve instance metadata is to use the link-local address, which is 169.254.169.254.

For more information about instance metadata, see Retrieve instance metadata.


B
curl http://localhost/latest/meta-data
Incorrect. The use of localhost will not work because this solution checks an IP address of 127.0.0.1. Metadata is not available through the use of the localhost name.

For more information about instance metadata, see Retrieve instance metadata.


C
curl http://254.169.254.169/latest/meta-data
Incorrect. The format for the link-local address is 169.254.169.254.

For more information about instance metadata, see Retrieve instance metadata.


D
curl http://192.168.0.1/latest/meta-data
Incorrect. The 192.168.x.x. IP address range is a public block. Instance metadata is not available through a public block.

For more information about instance metadata, see Retrieve instance metadata.

Question
A company has an application that runs on a large general purpose Amazon EC2 instance type that is part of an EC2 Auto Scaling group. The company wants to reduce future costs associated with this application. After the company reviews metrics and logs in Amazon CloudWatch, the company notices that this application runs randomly a couple of times a day to retrieve and manage data. According to CloudWatch, the maximum runtime for each request is 10 minutes, the memory use is 4 GB, and the instances are always in the running state.

Which solution will reduce costs the MOST?

Report Content Errors

A
Deploy the application on a large burstable EC2 instance.
Incorrect. This solution would keep the EC2 instance in the running state 24 hours a day. This solution would not reduce costs.

For more information about EC2 costs, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand Pricing.


B
Refactor the application code to run as an AWS Lambda function.
Correct. Lambda is a fully managed service that would automatically scale when necessary and would be highly available. A solution that deploys the application as a Lambda function reduces costs the most.

For more information about Lambda, see What Is AWS Lambda?


C
Containerize the application by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Host the container on EC2 instances.
Incorrect. This solution would not reduce costs because this solution would still require EC2 instances to be in the running state beyond the run duration of each request.

For more information about Amazon EKS, see Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service.


D
Use AWS Instance Scheduler to start and stop the instances based on the runtimes in the logs.
Incorrect. This solution would not be appropriate because the request times are unpredictable. This solution would create scenarios where the application would not be available because instance launches are not correctly scheduled. This solution would also incur unnecessary costs because the company would be charged on an hourly basis for the EC2 instances instead of on the basis of exact runtimes.

For more information about AWS Instance Scheduler, see Instance Scheduler on AWS.
